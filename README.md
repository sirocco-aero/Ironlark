# Ironlark

A playable Linux world where real drone autonomy software perceives, plans and
flies. Missions will span departure, outdoor travel, GPS-denied exploration,
inspection and return. Everything is simulated. Named for the holding
pattern: sit back and watch autonomy fly.

Today: a reproducible Webots–ArduPilot flight (take off, hover, land on EKF3
with simulated GPS) over a Poly Haven pine forest, on a hilltop above a
valley. What comes next is in
[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## Quick start

Needs Linux x86-64, a working OpenGL display/GPU driver, Docker (with daemon
access), [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) including `uvx`, `git`, `xvfb-run` for
headless checks, and
[Webots R2025a](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/tag/R2025a)
extracted to `./webots/`. Renderer compilation also needs C and C++ compilers,
make, and development libraries for OpenGL, GLU, OpenAL, FreeType and zlib.
`doctor` lists missing tools and libraries using compile/link probes.

```sh
./ironlark setup           # pinned SITL/ROS images, Python env and bridge assets
./ironlark doctor          # list missing runtime and build requirements
./ironlark build-renderer  # compile the patched renderer
./ironlark check           # validate takeoff/hover/land in the empty world
./ironlark build-world     # resumable forest export and drone build
./ironlark doctor          # verify forest readiness
./ironlark run             # watch the forest flight, fullscreen
```

| Command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `setup` | Builds ArduPilot Copter 4.7.1 (`dbe7921`) in an Ubuntu 22.04 image, which keeps only the SITL binary, its parameters and pymavlink (0.3 GB; Docker's build cache holds the rest); extracts its Iris model and Webots bridge to `.cache/`; creates `.venv/` (Python 3.12.11, NumPy, Pillow). System Python is untouched. |
| `doctor` | Lists missing runtime and renderer build requirements, and forest readiness. |
| `build-world` | Downloads Blender 4.2.9 and the [Poly Haven Pine Forest](https://polyhaven.com/collections/pine_forest) scene (checksummed), exports it stage by stage, and assembles `worlds/pine_forest/`. Resumable; `--skip-export` only reassembles. |
| `build-drone` | Models the drone in Blender and writes `protos/IronlarkDrone.proto` (also run by `build-world`, and by `run`/`check` when missing). |
| `build-renderer` | Builds patched Webots into `.cache/webots-renderer/`. See [Webots patches](#webots-patches). |
| `render-reference` | Cycles renders of the source scene at the preview cameras, into `runs/reference/`: the ground truth for looks. Needs more than ~26 GB RAM (15 GB + zram was not enough); needs no built world. |
| `run` | Flies over the forest in a fullscreen window, then exits. Until the autopilot can arm (EKF3 learning its gyro biases, ~40 s of simulated time) the simulation runs as fast as it can, the view at 10 fps; takeoff comes ~16 s after launch. `--world empty` for the bare test area; `--editor` for Webots' UI; `--record` streams the sensors to ROS 2 and records a rosbag2 in the run folder (in real time throughout). |
| `replay RUN` | Plays a recorded run's bag in the ROS 2 container; its `/clock` topic carries Webots time. |
| `check-recording RUN` | Checks a recorded empty-world flight against the calibration wall: LiDAR distance and orientation, camera ↔ LiDAR agreement. |
| `check-replay RUN` | Replays a recorded flight while recording it again and compares: same messages, stamps and static transforms. |
| `check` | The same flight on a virtual display, empty world by default. Exits nonzero on failure. |

For empty-world flights, Webots is chosen in order: `WEBOTS_HOME`, a current
patched build, `./webots/`. The forest needs a current `build-renderer`: stock
Webots cannot read its patched fields, DDS textures or HDR sky. Existing builds
need one rebuild for the new manifest; changes to the patch series, native
sources or Webots checkout edits require another. To ignore a `WEBOTS_HOME`
override in sh or fish, use `env -u WEBOTS_HOME ./ironlark run`.

Builds compile uncommitted Webots edits and serve changed resources from its
working tree. Failed compiles leave the previous runtime in place; downloads
use checksum-verified `.part` files. Compiler/linker errors print on failure;
full logs and metrics stay in `.cache/build-logs/`.
First setup needs internet and several GB of disk. OS packages in the image float,
so builds are source-pinned, not bit-identical.

Configure in files, not panels; restart to apply:
[`worlds/flight_foundation.wbt`](worlds/flight_foundation.wbt) (empty-world scene, vehicle, camera, timestep),
[`config/flight.parm`](config/flight.parm) (autopilot overrides),
[`config/sensors.json`](config/sensors.json) (sensor poses, rates, ranges, noise),
[`tests/flight_smoke.py`](tests/flight_smoke.py) (the flight check),
[`ironlark`](ironlark) (startup, versions, cleanup),
[`tools/`](tools) (the forest pipeline).

## What `check` proves

Native Webots runs the physics; containerized ArduPilot SITL flies. The upstream
bridge carries dynamics and sensors to SITL and motor outputs back; a small Iris
adapter treats disabled outputs as stopped, not reversed, and runs the per-step
lockstep in C (`controllers/flight_bridge/lockstep.c`, compiled by the launcher;
the Python loop when no compiler is found). MAVLink uses TCP 5760,
the bridge UDP 9002–9003. Occupied ports and concurrent runs are refused.

Pass requires EKF3, GPS fix, a valid position estimate, accepted commands,
sustained hover and disarm after landing. A separate supervisor records ground
truth, read only after landing: peak height 2.5–4 m, final ≤ 0.2 m, drift
≤ 1.5 m, autopilot and Webots clocks within 1 s.

Parameters load as: Copter SITL defaults, the Iris example, then
`flight.parm`, which enables EKF3 and tunes gains for 4.7 at 500 Hz. Pre-arm
checks stay on. Every run starts with fresh autopilot storage.

[`docker/webots-clock.patch`](docker/webots-clock.patch) fixes the pinned
bridge: after a packet delay it could reset its timestamp against a stale
wall clock, repeatedly adding elapsed time to the autopilot. The patch keeps the
timestamp across delays and rebases only when Webots time goes backwards.

**Localization boundary.** The Iris example uses simulator truth
(`AHRS_EKF_TYPE=10`); Ironlark sets EKF3 (`3`), and the check rejects truth mode.
Position still comes from simulated GPS, which ArduPilot synthesizes from the
physical state Webots reports. GPS denial must be cut at the measurement layer,
never by removing that state. Feeding evaluator pose in as odometry is not
localization.

Each run writes `runs/<timestamp>/`: `manifest.json` (versions, Webots patches,
world, estimator), `result.json` (verdict, transitions, measurements),
`telemetry.jsonl`, evaluator-only `ground_truth.jsonl`, `world-map.png` (forest), and Webots, SITL and
ArduPilot logs. Ctrl+C or failure tears everything down; that is cleanup, not a
recovery policy.

## Sensors and ROS 2

The drone ([`tools/build_drone.py`](tools/build_drone.py)) keeps the Iris flight model (motors,
propeller constants, mass, inertia, collision box, and the noiseless IMU and GPS ArduPilot reads)
and carries the rig of `config/sensors.json`: a Mid-360-class LiDAR (360° × 59°, −7° to +52°,
0.1–40 m, 10 Hz, 32 × 900 returns), an IMU (250 Hz, seeded white noise) and a front camera
(640 × 480, 90°, 20 Hz, with the scattering fog). With `--record`, the flight
controller samples them after each 2 ms physics step, on Webots time, and streams them over local
TCP ([`sensing/protocol.py`](sensing/protocol.py)); a full queue drops and counts, never stalling
physics, and pausing stops the clock. A ROS 2 Humble container ([`ros/`](ros)) publishes `/clock`,
`/imu/data`, `/lidar/points` (x, y, z, ring, time), `/camera/image_raw` (bgra8),
`/camera/camera_info` and `/tf_static`, ground truth only on `/ground_truth/pose` and
`/ground_truth/velocity`, and records all of it with rosbag2 (reliable, deep queues: `ros/record_qos.yaml`; each message compressed with zstd, losslessly: a forest flight's minute is 1.2 GB, the empty world's 0.16 GB). A recorded check adds sensing's cost to `result.json` (real-time factor, messages sent and dropped). Frames are REP-103: Webots' world is
ENU and bodies FLU; [`sensing/frames.py`](sensing/frames.py) is the one place for ENU/FLU ↔ NED/FRD.

## Webots patches

Ironlark patches Webots where Webots is the bottleneck, rather than degrading
assets to suit it. No fork: [`native/patches/`](native/patches) is a series of
`git format-patch` commits, one per feature, applied in order to
[R2025a](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/c6793d8f7230a311c4bc2a3101d9f1a8bc0aa01b)
(`c6793d8`, Apache 2.0). Each patch's message says what it changes and why, and
what each patch of the earlier numbered series it replaces measured.
`./ironlark build-renderer` fetches sparse sources and matching headers, makes
the series branch `ironlark` of `.cache/webots-source/` (upstream plus one commit
per patch; the same series always gives the same commits), compiles `glad`,
`wren` and `webots` against the installed R2025a libraries, and installs to
`.cache/webots-renderer/`, beside the untouched stock `./webots/`. Moving the
branch rewrites only the files that differ, so only they recompile: a one-line
edit to the last patch saves in 1 s and builds in 7 s; to the fog patch, in 9 s,
the later patches' files coming back from `ccache` (when installed).

Measured with `tools/profile_forest.py` (GTX 1060 3 GB, i5-4670):

| Patch | Changes | Measured |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **0001-Filmic-tone-mapping-and-HDR-sky** | Blender's Filmic "Medium High Contrast" as a 65³ table (`tools/bake_filmic_lut.py`) replaces `1 − e^(−x)` plus gamma, within 1.3/255 of Blender at the 99th percentile. `Background` accepts `.hdr` faces, kept as half-float linear radiance. PBR diffuse light is linear in intensity, which equals Blender sun strength. | frame unchanged; +12 MB VRAM |
| **0002-Alpha-masked-foliage** | `PBRAppearance.alphaCutoff` (glTF `MASK`): texels cut, not blended, with mip-scaled alpha. Masked materials draw both faces, back faces shaded towards the viewer. Minified normal maps shade by the mipmapped normal, darkened by its length (how much its texels disagree), instead of a frame from screen derivatives; degenerate frames fall back to the surface normal. | frame 31 → 22 ms (shadows off) |
| **0003-Instanced-shapes-and-visibility-ranges** | `Shape.instancesUrl`: one shape at every transform in a binary file, culled per instance, one instanced call (mirroring transforms in a second, front face inverted). `Shape.visibilityRange`: a camera-distance band, per instance. Passes that cannot place instances skip them (picking caught phantoms at the origin). A camera's frustum follows it after `view()` (robot cameras culled with their first frustum). | load 42 → 20 s, frame 25 → 5.7 ms, RAM 3.7 → 2.3 GB, 16,814 → 185 geometries |
| **0004-Cascaded-shadow-maps** | Directional lights cast through three cascaded shadow maps (2048², 100 m), not stencil volumes: any mesh size, alpha masks included, instanced casters culled per cascade at the viewer's LOD; far cascades reused until the view leaves them. Alpha-masked casters keep each shadow texel with probability equal to their coverage. | frame 5.7 → 12.3 ms; main sun under canopy vs Cycles 0.30× → 0.79× |
| **0005-Water-transmission-and-flowing-foam** | `PBRAppearance.transmission` (thin surface, Fresnel for IOR 1.333, premultiplied) and `flowFoam`: the source river's foam recipe on the UVs, white and opaque, animated by simulation time. | river pixels only |
| **0006-Tree-impostors** | `Shape.impostor`: instances drawn as quads showing the three captured views (8 × 8 hemi-octahedral atlas) nearest the camera's direction, lit from captured mean normals, with per-texel depth (`depth_greater`: hidden fragments rejected before shading). | backdrop 59 → 20 ms per step; impostors ≈ full trees within 4%; impostor pass 7.1 → 4.2 ms |
| **0007-Baked-light-occlusion** | `Background.lightOcclusion*`: baked light visibility layers at heights above the ground (sky, suns without shadow maps, the shadowed sun past its cascades, the sky overhead), mirrored outside. PBR surfaces scale image-based lighting and the unshadowed suns by them; near the viewer those suns also take the shadowed sun's maps, looked up once per pixel. | sky light under canopy vs Cycles 3.5–3.9× → 1.5–1.7×; +2 ms |
| **0008-Screen-space-reflections-on-water** | The opaque scene (colour, depth) is copied before translucent objects draw; transmissive surfaces march their reflection across it, taking the colour of what they hit or pass behind, the sky only where rays leave the screen. | river colour vs Cycles within 10%; +0.3 ms |
| **0009-Scattering-fog** | `Fog { fogType "SCATTERING" }`: single-scattering medium in HDR (density, colour, Henyey–Greenstein anisotropy, box) for the main view and robot cameras, lit through the light occlusion layers, the shadow maps near the viewer (shafts) and the sky it scatters along each view direction (`Fog.ambientRadiance`). `boxFalloff`, `boxFalloffHorizontal`: density thins past the box's faces. `horizonRadiance`: far haze meets the sky at the horizon. `hazeDistance`: land past the box takes the horizon's colour with distance. | ~1–2 ms; its added light matches Cycles (×1.34 vs ×1.34); fog pass 6.9–8.9 ms at 1920×1080 |
| **0010-Viewpoint-bounds-and-navigation** | `Viewpoint.boundsMin/boundsMax` and `groundClearance` (a physics ray down): navigation and scripts slide along the limits. Left-drag orbits the surface the main view drew at the press (its depth, nearest within 4 px) when within 30 m (or 1.5× the view's height) and the bounds, else turns in place; both 0.25°/px, within 85° of level. Pan and zoom scale by that surface; the wheel by a physics ray (floor 2 m). | 200 px drags: valley from the high view 135 m → 0 (turns); overview 97 → 29–44 m; 1000 px tilt flipped over → stops at 85° |
| **0011-Multisampling-and-temporal-anti-aliasing** | Opt-in multisampling (`OpenGL/multisampling`, default 0) with alpha to coverage. Temporal anti-aliasing in the main view (`OpenGL/temporalAntiAliasing`, on): Halton jitter, history reprojected through depth, Catmull-Rom, neighbourhood clamp, depth rejection; robot cameras single-frame. | 4 samples: flicker −31%, +9.4 ms; TAA: flickering needles 3.9% → 0.36% of canopy pixels, +1.5% frame time |
| **0012-Terrain-detail** | `Background.terrainDetail*` and `PBRAppearance.terrainDetail`: near the viewer the ground takes the source's tiled layers (leaves, ground, rocky trail, by its `path`/`river` masks) as detail over its 2.5 cm bake. Roughness and mask stored as R8 and RG8. | GPU −56 MB (R8/RG8) |
| **0013-Range-sensors-and-device-overlays** | Range sensors draw instanced shapes and cut alpha-masked texels (impostors stay out). A camera or range finder overlay created after the world restored its perspective takes its saved visibility, size and position. | forest scan at 2.5 m: 20.8 k of 28.8 k returns, median 17 m |
| **0014-Frame-profiler** | `IRONLARK_FRAME_LOG=FILE`: each rendered view (main, robot cameras, range sensors) logs the CPU and GPU time of its passes, each main-view frame and physics step its clock times; `IRONLARK_FRAME_LOG_DRAWS=1` times every draw. [`tools/frame_log.py`](tools/frame_log.py) summarizes. | nothing unless set |
| **0015-Real-time-pacing** | Each step is due when the clock reaches the time it simulates; more than three frames late, the simulation slows instead. A frame is due one period after the last one started. Frames showed 36, 136, 38 ms of simulated time in turn. | forest flight 1920×1080: 6.8 → 7.8 fps, simulated time per frame p99 175 → 124 ms, 0.77× → 0.90× real time; empty world with sensing 0.82× → 1.0× |
| **0016-Instance-culling-cells-and-occlusion** | Instances sorted into 64 m cells and 16 m sub-cells, culled a cell at a time, spheres computed once, cells packed. Colour views cull instances hidden behind what they drew: last frame's visible set first, then a max-depth pyramid tests the rest; a view hiding under 10 M triangles draws in one pass until it draws 10 M more. Exact. `IRONLARK_OCCLUSION=0` turns it off. | camera frame 130 → 62 M triangles, 82 → 59 ms; forest view 88 → 70 ms; LiDAR scan CPU 22 → 14 ms; RAM −45 MB |
| **0017-Mesh-memory-and-load-time** | WREN merges identical vertices ([`native/vertex_index.hpp`](native/vertex_index.hpp)), builds each GPU mesh once, orders it for the vertex cache ([meshoptimizer](https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer), vendored in [`native/meshoptimizer/`](native/meshoptimizer)), uses 16-bit indices where they fit and builds stencil shadow volumes on first use. `WEBOTS_MESH_CACHE=DIR` keeps each mesh file's parse and vertex-cache order; file meshes reach WREN indexed; Webots' CPU copy keeps one set of coordinates and per-vertex float normals and texcoords. Images, LiDAR and physics unchanged (vertex-cache order: ≤0.02% of pixels, depth ties). | load 98 → 49 s (first three steps), 24 → 13 s (mesh cache), 8.0 → 7.0 s (indexed); RAM −1.5 GB, later −0.77 GB (CPU copies); GPU −45 MB; forest view 70.0 → 67.1 ms (vertex-cache order) |
| **0018-Compressed-textures** | `ImageTexture` reads BC7 and opaque BC1 DDS (mip levels included), no CPU copy; cached compressed textures never regenerate mipmaps. Decoded PNG textures are freed once uploaded. | GPU 2830 → 2376 MB, RAM 2199 → 1865 MB; RAM −335 MB (PNGs freed) |
| **0019-Cheaper-PBR-shaders** | Same images for less GPU work: PBR vertex shaders without per-vertex matrix inverses; pen texcoords read only in a `#define PEN` twin program; impostors test coverage first. | forest view −3.6 ms (vertex transforms), −2.0 ms (pen variant); overview −0.45 ms (impostors) |
| **0020-Faster-load-lazy-icons** | `webots-bin` links the system zlib ahead of assimp's copy; a world's PNG/JPEG files decode on a thread pool before its nodes finalize; toolbar and menu icons decode when first drawn. Same pixels. | forest load 12.8 → 11.0 s, 9.5 → 8.0 s; RAM 719 → 655 MB |
| **0021-Outer-light-occlusion** | `Background.lightOcclusionOuter*`: light layers over a larger rectangle at the ground as it lies, used past the first by surfaces and the fog; past both, open land in full light. | — |
| **0022-Water-depth-colour-and-wind-ripples** | `PBRAppearance.attenuationColor`/`attenuationDistance` (glTF volume attenuation, along the path to what lies behind, from the scene's depth copy), `scatterColor` (deep water's own colour) and `waves` (wind ripples 3 m to 0.1 m drifting downwind in gusts, finer ones as roughness). Drawn by a `WATER` variant of the material's program (the pen twin generalized), so other materials' shaders are unchanged. The valley's lake and river use it. | GPU +0.3 ms with the lake filling the view (15.4 → 15.7 ms), other valley views within noise; forest views bit-identical |

After a build, `.cache/webots-source/` is a git checkout on branch `ironlark`,
where `git log`, `git blame` and `git rebase -i` work on the series. A new
feature is a new commit there (message: what it changes, why, what it measured).
An edit to an existing patch stays uncommitted:
`.venv/bin/python tools/save_webots_patch.py fog` folds it into the patch whose
name holds `fog`. Without a name, the tool writes the branch to
`native/patches/`. Then `./ironlark build-renderer`, `./ironlark check`,
`./ironlark check --world forest`, and the patch's row here (the tool names
patches without one). The builder never
moves the branch past commits not saved as patches. Tracked uncommitted edits
must be saved as patches before building so the published manifest describes
the actual compiled inputs. Keep each patch one feature, clean enough to become an
upstream pull request.

A newer Webots release: in the checkout, `git fetch --depth 1 origin tag R2025b`
and `git rebase --onto R2025b c6793d8f`, resolving conflicts patch by patch;
then `RELEASE` and `COMMIT` in `tools/renderer_support.py`, that release
installed as `./webots/`, and a save.

`tools/render_lighting_reference.py` renders the built world in Cycles under the
source's own suns, world, fog and Filmic view (4.6 GB; the full source needs more
than ~26 GB); `tools/compare_views.py runs/lighting-reference runs/preview` scores
`tools/render_forest.py` views against it.
`tools/profile_forest.py --out runs/<name>` reports load time, real-time factor,
frame rate, GPU and CPU time per render pass and peak RAM/GPU for the forest as a
viewer sees it (headless: under `xvfb-run -a -s "-screen 0 1920x1080x24"`, which
renders on the NVIDIA GPU; its swap waits for a readback, so frames come slower than
on a display). Any run can log frames: `IRONLARK_FRAME_LOG=/tmp/f.log ./ironlark run`,
then `tools/frame_log.py /tmp/f.log --from 41 --to 60` (simulated seconds).
`tests/test_vertex_index.cpp` proves hard normals and UV seams survive indexing
and that a large mesh's attributes reconstruct byte-for-byte:
`g++ -std=c++11 -O2 tests/test_vertex_index.cpp -o .cache/test_vertex_index && .cache/test_vertex_index`.

## Research atlas

159 drone autonomy projects and 126 sourced relationships, in
[`research/dataset.json`](research/dataset.json), which omits the fields that follow
from others (`identity`, `referenceOnly`, `assemblyGroup`, `classificationReason`, a
project's repository as first source, edge `id`); the viewer rebuilds them and its
download button exports the full records.
`python3 research/build_html.py` builds `research/drone-autonomy-atlas.html`,
which opens offline in a browser; source links need internet.
